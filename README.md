# LaTeX Template for Undergraduate Thesis at School of EECS, Peking University

The initial author of the repository is Bochen Tan. [SceneryInMirror](https://github.com/SceneryInMirror/) has made invaluable contributions.

I made this Latex template as 'green' as possible, meaning that it does not depend on other things than Latex.

There are mainly two branches: 'master' which follows the .doc file quite rigidly and depend on ctex package 'non-ctex' which is free from ctex. 'non-ctex' contains some variations from the .doc file, but definitely no direct violations. (There are some details that is not explicitly regulated in the .doc file, so we can make up our own minds.)

Beware to change the font names (songti, heiti, kaiti, and Times New Roman) according to your operating system. The font names in 'non-ctex' is tailored to my Mac OS.


## 'cover' has been merged to 'master'

The project's author is TBC. Based on TBC's code, SceneryInMirror added the cover and reviewtable in branch 'cover'.

There are five .tex files:

* Template.tex
* Cover.tex
* ReviewTable.tex
* CoverHead.tex
* ReviewTableHead.tex

'Template.tex' is the main body of the project. You can write your thesis here.

'Cover.tex' designs the cover of this template.

'ReviewTable.tex' designs the reviewtable of this template.

'CoverHead.tex' and 'ReviewTableHead.tex' are head files for cover and reviewtable. They contain all packages needed for these two parts. **please change the name of kaiti to the name of kaiti in your operating system**

**There is no need to edit the last four .tex files. Everything you want to write is in 'Template.tex', including the words in the cover.**

'Template.pdf' is the output of this project.
